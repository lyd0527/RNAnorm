# RNAnorm
Normalization of RNA-seq expression counts


### Supported methods:

- Counts per million (CPM)
- Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM)
- Transcript per kilobase million (TPM)


### Filtering
### output for coexpression network construction
### output for housekeeping screening

- MADs
- coefficient of variation (CV)
